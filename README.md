thomasg's blog
==============
This is my blog, based on (Pelican)[http://blog.getpelican.com/]

This repo contains largely my custom templates, CSS and the pelican config.
It also contains a small deployment script, ``pelitool.zsh``, written in zsh,
which you might find useful if you have a pelican based blog.

Feel free to reuse everything you find here, but I'd appreciate if you wouldn't clone my site ;)
